======================
This sample app implements viewpager but in uncommon way for better approach. The Whole viewpager
is in inside of a Fragment which extending from mother activity. That makes the app more dynamic.
There is also a process for data passing between fragment. Many people face this problem to create viewpager
inside of a fragment and it will help I think.
